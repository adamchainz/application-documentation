Documentation should be:

* :doc:`structured </structure>` correctly
* written using valid `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_/`restructuredText
  <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_ syntax (see :doc:`/markup` for specifics)
* in files with the extension ``.rst``
* wrapped at 100 characters per line
* written in English, using British English spelling and punctuation
* accessible - you should assume the reader to be moderately familiar with Python and Django, but
  not anything else. Link to documentation of libraries you use, for example, even if they are
  “obvious” to you

Your documentation should be reviewed before it is committed, just like code.

English standards
*****************

Not everyone is very confident about being able to write English to an appropriate standard for
documentation, and even if they are, they might still not be sure about what spelling and
punctuation standards to use.

In this case, **don't worry**. The only important thing is to make sure that someone in the
documentation team reviews your text.

Similarly, you don't need to worry about writing beautiful or elegant English. In fact, *don't try
to make it correct*: just make it as simple and clear as possible - and ask for a documentation
review.

As long as your text is understandable, it can easily be rewritten to conform with standards, so
don't hesitate to write down the basic information and push it to a branch where someone can do
any necessary further work on it.
