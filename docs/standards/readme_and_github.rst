README.rst

The README file should be written in RST.

Typically it will repeat much the same information that is in the root ``index.rst`` file (see
:doc:`/standards/structure`).

You can also add badges for CI and so on.

It should also contain a brief note about how to contribute. Make sure it contains the following
text, or something very similar::


    ************
