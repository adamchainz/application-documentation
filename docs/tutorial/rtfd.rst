Publishing on Read the Docs
###########################

These steps are only possible if your project is *Public* on GitHub.

Go to your account on `Read the docs <http://readthedocs.org>`_ and hit **Import a project**, then
**Import from GitHub**.

Your project should be listed; hit its **Create** button.

Generally, you can leave all options on their default settings. Hit **Next**, then **Build**.

In a few moments, your documentation should be successfully built and available. Note that the *Build* page on Read the Docs does not automatically update; you will need to refresh it.

Hit **View** to see your published documentation, and all the typos and mistakes that you missed
when you were proof-reading it locally.

Future pushes to GitHub will rebuild the documentation automatically.
