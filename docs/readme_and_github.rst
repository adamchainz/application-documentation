The README file and GitHub fields

README.rst

The README file should be written in RST.

Typically it will repeat much the same information that is in the root ``index.rst`` file (see
:doc:`/structure`).

It should also contain a brief note about how to contribute and a description of requirements.

You can also add badges for CI and so on.

See `Aldryn Jobs <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-jobs/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for an example.

On GitHub, it's important to complete:

* the *Description* field
* the *link* field, referring to the project's website, or a project page if one exists, or at
  least to its documentation
